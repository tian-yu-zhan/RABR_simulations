1. The R code and simulation results are saved at “simulation_continuous_endpoints” folder for Section 5, and at “case_study_binary_endpoints” for Section 6. One may revise the directory path in each R file. Please keep the “results” folder and its “plot_data” subfolder in the default structure to save files properly.

2. To replicate Section 5 simulation studies

    A. In the “simulation_continuous_endpoints” folder, source “RAR_un_round_3_error.r” file to generate results for Table 1 of type I error rates. The results are already saved in the “results” sub folder.

    B. In the “simulation_continuous_endpoints” folder, source “RAR_un_round_3_power.r” file to generate results for Table 2 of power and Table 3 of ASN.

    C. After generating results from Step B, can source “RAR_un_table.r” file to generate Figure 1.

3. To replicate Section 6 case study

    A. In the “case_study_binary_endpoints” folder, source “RAR_un_binary_error.r” file to generate results of type I error rate. Then source “RAR_un_binary_table.r” to generate Figure 2.

    B. In the “case_study_binary_endpoints” folder, source “RAR_un_binary_power.r” file to generate results for Table 4 of power and ASN.
